[Reda Lemeden describes](https://redalemeden.com/microblog/post-1584954517771) how you can take full-page screenshots of webpages in Safari on macOS.

This is also doable in Safari on iOS (since iOS 13) by [taking a screenshot of a webpage](https://osxdaily.com/2020/02/06/how-take-fullpage-screenshots-safari-iphone-ipad/), or by using the “Markup” action in the activity view.

I’m looking into bringing those capabilities to Chrome on iOS too. Fingers crossed they aren’t private APIs.
