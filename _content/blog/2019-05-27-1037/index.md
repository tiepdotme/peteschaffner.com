Pay attention, respect the material, listen to how it guides you, and be gentle. You’ll be surprised by what you can do and how flexible it all can be.

This reminds me of another piece by him, “[The Web’s Grain](https://frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/)”, which talks about design that respects the medium.

Come to think of it, this also reminds me of his article “[What Screens Want](https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/)”. Am I sensing a trend here?
