I design software, and much of that work is done in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com). I’ve used it my whole career and will continue to do so as long as it stays a native app. Lucky for me, [I think it will](https://www.sketch.com/blog/2020/10/26/part-of-your-world-why-we-re-proud-to-build-a-truly-native-mac-app/). (Kudos to whoever set that headline in ITC Garamond Narrow, and shame on whoever set the text in it.)

[I was also worried](/words/2020-03-24-2346/) that [Origami Studio](https://origami.design), another great tool I use, would go with Electron for their next big release, but I’m happy I was wrong!
