[Important words to remember](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2014/the-only-note-to-self/) by Frank Chimero:

> You don’t get to decide the truth. Other people have their own experiences, just as valid. This is easy to forget. Your slice of life seems so large and unmistakeable, but it is your job to not confuse your small piece for the whole. Life is big—much bigger than just yours. This is the only note to self: other people are real. That’s all there is to learn.
