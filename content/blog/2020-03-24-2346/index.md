Prediction: [Origami Studio](https://origami.design) will follow in [the path of Spark AR Studio](https://milen.me/software/#software-arstudio-mac) and become a cross-platform app. I imagine they will go a [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) route (as apposed to C++ and [Qt](https://www.qt.io) like they did with Spark), as I don’t think performance will be as important.

I hope I’m wrong.
