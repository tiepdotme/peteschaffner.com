> This also isn’t a time to try to simulate the office. Working from home is not working from the office. Working remotely is not working locally. Don’t try to make one the other. If you have meetings all day at the office, don’t simply simulate those meetings via video. *This is an opportunity not to have those meetings* [emphasis added]. Write it up instead, disseminate the information that way. Let people absorb it on their own time. Protect their time and attention.
