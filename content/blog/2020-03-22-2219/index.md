I keep up with things that interest me by subscribing to blogs on the internet. For this I use a service called [Feedbin](http://feedbin.com), which aggregates all my feeds in one place and keeps them up-to-date.

Next I use a [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator) called [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/) on my iPhone and iPad to actually read through all those blog posts. And when Iâ€™m at my Mac, I use [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/).

Here are some other great feed readers for macOS and iOS:

- [Reeder](https://reederapp.com)
- [ReadKit](https://readkitapp.com)
- [News Explorer](https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html)
- [Newsbite](https://newsbite.app/)
