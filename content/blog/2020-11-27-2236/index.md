Steve Troughton-Smith [writes about Catalyst](https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190601-Why-Apple-needs-iPad-apps-on-the-Mac):

> That NeXT competitive advantage became Apple's competitive advantage, and, later, iPhone's competitive advantage. This is the competitive advantage a native platform from Apple has over the web; it would be such a shame to half-ass this transition to Marzipan and concede defeat to web apps on the desktop instead of letting native apps reach the heights they deserve.

So far, [Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/) (the official name for Marzipan) apps aren't that great. Not even the Apple ones. But they are getting better, and that's encouraging.

[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is maturing nicely too, and it seems to be a better option for creating quality cross-platform software. Apple also seems to be putting more focus on it than Catalyst, which is a good thing.

Oh, and one more thing: I can now run iOS/iPadOS apps on my M1 Mac. Buckle up.
