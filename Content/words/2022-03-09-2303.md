I prefer to use (and make) native software, so it was encouraging to read this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/siegel/status/1427067920102961154) by Rich Siegel, the maker of [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html).

I’m going to record it here both so it is easier to read and for archival purposes.

It is time to speak of many things. Before I start I want to make a few things crystal clear:\\

1. Except for my own experiences and matters of objective fact, everything I have to say about matters Electron-adjacent is MY OPINION. Don't @ me.

I was a Mac developer when Apple was doomed. I think that Electron apps ensure that macOS will forever remain *primarily* a platform for developing native software for OS devices (and associated work). Why?

[Tweet 37](https://twitter.com/siegel/status/1427090866108305420):

> Because thanks to Electron, the everyday business productivity tools that everyone (including OS developers) use can run on ANY platform. There’s no reason to buy a Mac if you don’t get to use the unique advantages of the platform (because Electron apps don’t expose them).

[Tweet 38](https://twitter.com/siegel/status/1427091453352849408):

> So, companies that use those everyday productivity tools can buy hardware for cost (and big companies do) because it doesn’t matter: they can all run Slack, GitHub Desktop, Skype, Dropbox (and MS Office is deployed natively everywhere, bless you [@Schwieb](https://twitter.com/Schwieb)), VS Code, whatever.
