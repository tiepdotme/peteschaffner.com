# Welcome

Hi, I'm Pete. I hail from Indiana, but live in France with my [wife](https://lauraschaffner.com), daughter, and son, where I wrangle pixels at [Shiny Frog](http://shinyfrog.net). I love type, software, and pottery.

I'm generally an open book, so please feel free to reach out. I'm available on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/peteschaffner), [GitHub](https://github.com/peteschaffner), and via [email](mailto:hello@peteschaffner.com).
